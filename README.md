# Deeper-Caverns
Deeper Caverns is a fresh take on a Nether overhaul mod for Minecraft 1.14.4. This new Nether will be made of three layers: the biolayer, the mantle, and the core. You get to this new Nether with a regular portal made of chiseled obsidian.
The biolayer will populated by diverse flora and fauna, except for Hell and the Soulands. It has a more organic theme than the other layers.The mantle will have a more rocky theme with some fire. Ghasts will roam its vast caverns. The core will have a heavy fire and stone theme, making it a lot like an expanded classic Nether. 
In all the layers, there will be new NPCs to visit and trade with, new biomes to explore, new structures to loot, and new enemies to battle.
